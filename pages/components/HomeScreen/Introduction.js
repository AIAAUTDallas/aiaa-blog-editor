                    The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics has been expanding its presence on campus since its establishment in 2015. Our goal as an organization has always been to inspire and motivate engineers to pursue aerospace opportunities by creating a platform that ensures that members are able to engage in unique collegiate-level experiences.



                    Currently, we host the following platforms:

                    Design Build Fly

                    Research Aerospace Design

                    Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition

                    UT Dallas Drone Racing Team

                    Women of Aeronautics and Astronautics

        "description": "I have wanted to work for NASA since middle school. I didn't know that astronautics was really my passion until high school, however, when I started really getting into a lot of sci-fi and began imagining the way that space technology can change what it means to be human. Now that I have some exposure to the industry, I think my main interest is in launch vehicle systems and low earth orbit mobility. Later in my career, I would like to be involved in deep space technology, however. Possibly in advanced propulsion systems research.",

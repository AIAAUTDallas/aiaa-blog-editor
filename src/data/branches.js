  DEC: {
    name: 'Drone Engineering Corps',
    about:
      "DEC is the branch focused on the design of drones. As the main aerial robotics branch of AIAA UTD, members participate in the development of various drone systems for functional, recreational, or competitive purposes. This branch serves as an opportunity for those with or without experience in aerial robotics to establish UTD as a hub of drone design. DEC's research program is divided into multiple small teams working on separate projects.Research members are assigned meaningful tasks such as autonomous drone programming, drone assembly, movement planning, or part analysis.DEC's racing program is a large team bringing drone piloting to students. Racing members are given the opportunity to train in simulators to practice flying before being assigned one of the team's racing drones.Using radio controllers and first- person view goggles, pilots can fly racing drones head- to - head or in timed trials.",

      "CR is the branch focused on the design of rockets. As the main high-power rocketry branch of AIAA UTD, members participate in the development of large, high-impulse rockets for individual certifications or international competitions. This branch serves as an opportunity for those with or without experience in high-power rocketry to foster a foundation for competitive rocket design at UTD. CR's L1 program is divided into multiple small teams working on separate L1 certifications.Successfully certified teams are then permitted to join the competition program.CR's competition program is a large, interdisciplinary team representing UTD at Spaceport America Cup and NASA Student Launch. The team is further divided into the Simulation, Structures, Avionics, Payload, and Ground Station teams.",

    name: 'Design Build Fly',
    about:
      'DBF is the branch focused on the design of aircraft. As the main fixed-wing aviation branch of AIAA UTD, members participate in the development of a large, radio-controlled aircraft for the international AIAA Design/Build/Fly competition. Every year, 110 university teams are selected to plan, construct, validate, and demonstrate an aircraft that can perform three flight and one ground mission with various payload configurations. Following the submission of a design proposal and report, teams will be invited to the flyoffs in April, alternating yearly between Tucson, Arizona and Wichita, Kansas. This branch serves as an opportunity for those with or without experience in fixed-wing aviation to foster a foundation for competitive aircraft design at UTD. DBF is a large, interdisciplinary team officially representing the university. The team is further divided into the Aerodynamics, Mechanics, and Electronics teams.',

    about:
      'ARC is the branch focused on the study of aerospace applications. As the main introductory branch of AIAA UTD, members participate in semester-long engineering projects related to drones, aircraft, rockets, or wind turbines. This branch prioritizes underclassmen with little or no technical experience to become familiar with the engineering design process. ARC is divided into multiple small teams working on unique topics curated by project leaders. All teams are required to complete and present a deliverable of their topic by the end of the semester.',
